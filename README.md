# scratch

Various little scripts I wrote to help me out.

- `rm-rspec-focus` - remove the little `focus: true` tags in rspec files.
- `mp3` - listen to a selection of radio streams using mplayer.
- `desk-clean` - clean up files on the desktop by sorting them into bins based on file extensions
- `chuck` - toss a file into the junk pile. Got a random script you don't want
  to throw away but also don't want to include in a repository? Toss it into
  the junk pile with a note about how it got there
- _and more!_

## installation

`./install` will symlink `bin/*` to `/usr/local/bin`
