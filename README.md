# scratch

Various little scripts I wrote to help me out.

- `rm-rspec-focus` - remove the little `focus: true` tags in rspec files.
- `mp3` - listen to a selection of radio streams using mplayer.
- `desk-clean` - clean up files on the desktop by sorting them into bins based on file extensions
- _and more!_

## installation

`./install` will symlink `bin/*` to `/usr/local/bin`
